Welcome to My Personal Website  I’m Ngọc — a mobile app developer passionate about creating meaningful digital tools for healthcare and everyday life. This site is where I share my journey, showcase my projects, and offer insights into the development process.
My primary focus is building mobile applications that support medical professionals, patients, and health-conscious individuals. From clinical utilities to wellness trackers, I aim to make technology more accessible and impactful in the healthcare space.

Beyond medicine, I also explore apps that improve daily living — whether it’s productivity, education, or personal growth. I believe technology should serve real human needs, and I’m excited to contribute to that mission.

Here, you’ll find updates on my latest projects, articles sharing development tips, and resources for those interested in mobile innovation. Whether you’re a fellow developer, a healthcare worker, or simply curious, I hope you find something useful and inspiring.

Let’s build better tools for a better life.
